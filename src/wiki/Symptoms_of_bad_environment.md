This is indicative of high humidity and/or a lack of ventilation. If the growing volume is not sufficiently ventilated, water cannot properly exit the stomata in the process of [transpiration](/Plant_processes#transpiration) and ends up pooling on the leaf's surface. Water on the leaf's surface can also be an indication that the foliage is too dense.
