There are many biological processes that occur, mostly simultaneously, in a living plant. Some processes continue even after the cultivar is harvested like in the case of the [[Harvesting, Drying and Curing|curing process]].

##Photosynthesis##
The Cannabis plant photosynthesizes in the presence of light like most plants, it is categorized as a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C3_carbon_fixation C3 plant.]

C3 carbon fixation in photosynthesis leads to several characteristics:
* Thrives where CO<sub>2</sub> concentration is > 200ppm (cannabis specifically thrives in >400ppm CO<sub>2</sub>)
* Cannot survive in very hot environments

Cannabis stands out from other plants for its tolerance to high light intensity. see [[Light#Ideal_light_conditions|Ideal light conditions]]

##Respiration##
Most plants are constantly respiring and cannabis is no exception. In the process of respiration, plants uptake CO<sub>2</sub> and expel Oxygen. CO<sub>2</sub> is essential to the process of photosynthesis. If a plant is exposed to less than 200ppm it will be unable to photosynthesize at all and will most likely die. Airflow or "wind speed" has a strong effect on the rates of respiration and transpiration.<ref>https://doi.org/10.1016/S0273-1177(02)00747-0 - Effects of air current speed on gas exchange in plant leaves and plant canopies (2003)</ref> The rate of respiration is directly correlated with the stomata density on growing leaves.<ref>John W. Kimball, 2020. Gas Exchange in Plants. Available at: https://bio.libretexts.org/@go/page/5785 [Accessed March 11, 2022].</ref>

### Supplimenting additional CO<sub>2</sub> ###
In a city typical Co<sub>2</sub> levels are around 400-450ppm. This is acceptable for a growing plant but raising levels above 1000ppm can increase growth rates by up to 30%<ref>B. A. Kimball, 1983, Carbon Dioxide and Agricultural Yield: An Assemblage and Analysis of 430 Prior Observations - https://doi.org/10.2134/agronj1983.00021962007500050014x</ref> <ref>Hendrik Poorter, 1993, Interspecific Variation in the Growth-Response of Plants to An Elevated Ambient CO2 Concentration - http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00048146</ref> when combined with sufficient light intensity by enabling higher rates of photosynthesis. For more on the limitation of low Co<sub>2</sub> at high levels of light intensity see: [[Light#Upper limit of light intensity|Upper limit of light intensity.]]

For more on how co<sub>2</sub> is applied in a grow setting see: [[Growing environments#Adding extra Co2|Adding extra Co<sub>2.</sub>]]

## Transpiration ##
The cultivar constantly moves water around internally via capillary action and releases water vapor into the environment through the stomata, this is the process of transpiration. The density of stomata and how open they are will determine the rate of transpiration. The [[Temperature and Humidity#VPD|VPD]] of a plant's environment will affect its stomal response and in turn, its rate of transpiration. For higher VPD values rate of transpiration is generally higher up until a maximum threshold<ref>Plant responses to rising vapor pressure deficit, Grossiord 2020 - https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.16485</ref>. For Cannabis the maximum VPD is around 1.6kPa (Seedlings should be exposed to 0.4-0.8kPa until they are established). The rate of transpiration is also correlated to the light intensity the plant is being exposed to i.e. High light intensity equals a high rate of transpiration. Of course, the inverse correlation between humidity and rate of transpiration has been known since the 1930s.<ref>RELATIVE HUMIDITY VARIATIONS AFFECTING TRANSPIRATION, Hiram F. Thut 1938 -https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1537-2197.1938.tb09265.x</ref> Wind speed and CO<sub>2</sub> levels also cause a plant response that will affect the rate of transpiration.

The rate of transpiration also affects the rate of water uptake through roots, this is because 97% of water Cannabis absorbs is lost via transpiration (this is a typical characteristic of a C3 plant). A higher water intake means that [[nutrients]] can be delivered more quickly.

##Circadian rhythm##
Like animals, plants also have a Circadian rhythm, a sort of internal biological clock that is programmed by external stimuli. It has been shown that matching a plant's environment to its natural circadian rhythm can increase photosynthesis<ref>https://doi.org/10.1126%2Fscience.1115581 - Plant Circadian Clocks Increase Photosynthesis, Growth, Survival, and Competitive Advantage (2005)</ref><ref>https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2015.00245 - Interactions between circadian clocks and photosynthesis for the temporal and spatial coordination of metabolism (2015)</ref><ref>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2014.03.014 - Leaf photosynthesis, plant growth, and carbohydrate accumulation of tomato under different photoperiods and diurnal temperature differences</ref>
