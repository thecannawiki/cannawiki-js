The various "life stages" of a cannabis plant can be used to identify and track the plant's progression towards maturity. At each stage, the plant desires a slightly different environment.

## Dormant ##
Before a seed is [germinated](/Seeds#germination-methods) it is alive but "dormant" inside its protective shell.

## Seedling
Once the radicle has emerged from the shell it will attempt to create a root. The seed will then shed the seed casing and use the Cotyledons to collect enough energy to grow the first real leaves. Generally the radicle will grow upwards at first and then make a U-turn and grow downwards into the growing medium. This allows the root/stem to then straighten out lifting the head of plant out of the soil and helping to shed the casing.

## Vegetative
In this stage, the plant grows the most and will be the most resilient to [High and Low-stress training](/Plant_training).

During the vegetative stage, pre-flowers will appear that can be used to identify the sex of the plant. If white pistils are seen emerging from the [bract](/Anatomy_of_Cannabis#bract) the plant is female, if the plant develops clusters of balls resembling grapes it is a male. See [sex](/Seeds#sex)

Ideal humidity: 40-70% RH

## Flowering
Once the plant reaches maturity it will stop branching and producing leaves to begin the production of buds. Water consumption will increase at this point. The start of flowering can be identified by the appearance of [stigma](/Anatomy_of_Cannabis#stigma). At this stage, all plant training to shape the canopy should be complete.

Ideal humidity: 40-50% RH

## Late-flowering
The last few weeks of flowering. At this stage lowering the humidity even further can increase yield and terpene content<sup>[citation needed]</sup>. Water consumption will decrease. Towards the end of flowering, fan leaves may turn yellow and even fall off the plant, this is a result of the plant running out of nitrogen and is normal.

Ideal humidity: <40% RH

## Re-vegetation
It is possible to re-vegetate a photo flowering plant that has already flowered so that it can enter flowering again and produce more buds.
