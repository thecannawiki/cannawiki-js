### Goals ###
* Provide up to date information on growing
* Serve as a platform for scientific discussion as well as differing methodology
* Be globally relevant
* Create a sustainable resource

###  Advantages ###
* The article structure allows all topics to fit within a framework. This means new information can easily be added in a logical location and users can easily navigate the structure.
* This structure of information means that a fact only appears in one place (Similar to [[wikipedia:Third_normal_form|3NF in databases]]). This makes the wiki more consise, (less duplication) and easier to maintain (any changes are made in one location, less risk of conflicting information).
* There are citations of any assertions made in articles. This allows the reader to dig deeper into an assertion if they wish.
* The discussion tools on Cannawiki.net and the [https://discord.gg/gnuNQPZrcV cannawiki discord] provide a way to resolve a conflict between competing hypothesis.
* Content creation is (more) decentralized due to the web2.0 nature of the platform. Anyone can read, anyone can write (content is moderated), the project is open-source.
* The wiki supports virtually infinite contributors and revisions to content.

### Methodology ###

* Prioritise keeping the number of articles to a minimum. This is to ensure articles are consise and fit within the logical framework
* Topics will only be discussed in-depth in a single page. This is to keep the important information in a single location to make maintainance easier. When discussing closely related topics, links should be added to point to the main topic location. In cases where a topic overlaps many articles a new article may be created for the topic.
