### Common solutions ###

#### Neem oil ####
Neem oil can be added to feed water to repel insects such as spider mites or thrips. Be aware that it has a delayed effect and should be applied preventatively.

#### Insecticidal soap ####
A soap that can be used to kill insects. Less aggressive than a pesticide and some can be made using household ingredients

#### Predator insects ####
It's possible to add "good" insects that will hunt the insects you want to remove. This is only recommended for outdoor grows.

Some example predators for spider mites are Phytoseiulus persimilis and Amblyseius californicus.

For Thrips, you might use Amblyseius cucumeris.
