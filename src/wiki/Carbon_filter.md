Typically, in indoor grows, the smell produced by a flowering plant is undesirable to have outside of the growing environment, this has spurred the invention of filters utilizing activated carbon to absorb this odor.

## 385 motor Fan ##
This is a centrifugal fan that can be 3D printed and is compatible with the Cannawiki grow controller. A motor driver such as the TB6612FNG is required so that it can be controlled. This fan is designed for the 385 motor to be driven at 12V, but most 385 motors can be run as low as 4.5V. 

This fan is also compatible with the filter below

#### Parts
* 385 Motor
* [Motor case](/images/V6_385_Motor_case.3mf) (3D printed)
* [Case top](/images/V7_385_case_top.3mf) (3D printed)
* [Install spacer](/images/V5_385_install_spacer.3mf) (3D printed)
* [Impeller](/images/V5_385_impeller.3mf) (3D printed)
* [Motor mount](/images/V5_385_motor_mount.3mf) (3D printed)
* 2.3mm grub screw prop adapter
* x3 M4 bolts
* x2 M2.5x3mm bolts
* 12v female barrel jack

#### Build steps:
This will work best with a well-calibrated printer, this design includes a lot of press fits. Some parts may require sanding after printing to fit correctly.

1. 3D Print all parts.

2. Solder wires onto the 385 motor if it doesn't already have them. 

3. Insert the motor into the Motor case feeding the wires back into the case through the slit. The wires can exit any side of the case from here

4. Add the case top on top of the motor and screw M2.5 screws through the top into the motor. Make sure the threaded holes on the motor are aligned with the case holes. Screw in the 3 M4 bolts to attach the top to the motor case.

5. Separately, put the prop adapter through the central hole of the impeller and tighten a nut on the other side.

6. Put the install spacer around the motor shaft. Then put the impeller onto the shaft on top of the spacer. The spacer will ensure there is clearance between the impeller and case floor. Tighten the grub screws of the prop adapter. This will require an M3 Allen key that is over 60mm long as you will have to reach under the impeller

7. Cover with Case top. This should clip into place and may require some trimming if it does not fit initially

8. Solder barrel jack socket to the wires

The fan can easily be mounted with heavy-duty Velcro, which makes for easy repairs

This fan is designed to be 3D printed and used as an exhaust fan with a filter using activated carbon pellets.

#### Steps
1. Take a standard 120mm PC case fan and remove the power cable from the frame of the fan. Cut the motor out of the frame with snips or a saw. Next, remove the fan blades from the fan hub. You may have to sand down the hub of the fan to remove the stubs of the fan blade.

2. 3D print parts

* [https://cannawiki.net/images/Filter_chamber_lid.3mf Filter chamber lid] (print on 0.1 layer height)
* [https://cannawiki.net/images/Filter_filler.3mf Filler tool] (optional, to make filling the chamber easier)
* [https://cannawiki.net/images/Screw_thread.3mf Screw thread]
* [https://cannawiki.net/images/Fan_case_top.3mf Fan case top]
* [https://cannawiki.net/images/Fan_blades.3mf Fan blades]
* [https://cannawiki.net/images/Fan_case_bottom.3mf Fan case bottom]


3. Glue the screw thread to the case top model so that it aligns with the hole and leave it to dry.

4. Glue the motor from the fan in the centre of the fan case bottom. The stubs around the centre should help to line it up. The cable should exit the fan case from the bottom.

5. Glue or press fit the fan blades onto the hub. Make sure the old fan blades are really removed from the hub, sanding will help.

6. Place the case top onto the assembled fan and seal around the edges with tape.

7. To fill the filter chamber with carbon pellets place the filler tool in the cavity of the filter chamber. The filler tool is just there to stop the pellets from getting into the central cavity.

8. Remove the filler tool and put the chamber lid in the mouth of the filter chamber. It should be flexible enough to bend into place under the tabs on the inside of the screw.

9. Screw the filter chamber onto the fan body. Unscrew and replace the carbon pellets every 6 months or when the filter becomes ineffective.
